								<h2><b>Chris Burnett</b></h2>
								<span class="byline">Student Intern at Year Up Chicago</span>
							</header>
<div class="paragraph">							
<p>I am a young professional from the Chicagoland area. I am 22 years old and I am the 3rd oldest of 12 kids. As a kid, I had my fair share of responsibility at a young age. My parents have instilled in me the importance of hard work, maintaining a good reputation, and being a good role model. With that being said I am currently a student at Year Up Chicago striving to further my education and set the precedent for my younger siblings that they too must seek a higher level of education.</p>

 <p>As of now, I have received extensive hands-on training in computer hardware, software, programming, as well as professional development, business writing, and public speaking. I want to use my opportunities and resources afforded to me at Year Up to become my best professional self so that upon seeking employment I am the best possible candidate for hire. I am interested in beginning my professional career in the IT Helpdesk field and expanding from there. Upon graduating the Year Up program in January 2017, I aspire to continue furthering my education at a 4-year University. Upon graduating from college I will return to my neighborhood to mentor young minorities and be a physical representation of the success we can achieve.</p>

<p>There have not been many positive examples of what young minorities in Chicago can achieve. The media always portrays Chicago to be this hateful city that is ridden with gang violence, but they never shine a light on the positive aspects of our communities. I hope to inspire the next generation of youth to become more invested in technology and more invested in our communities!</p>

<p>In the future I hope to own multiple properties, including my own private music studio, to generate equity and support my future endeavors. From there I would like to combine technology with music and teach minority youth in Chicagoâ€™s most undervalued neighborhoods on the south and west sides so that they may have a creative outlet to express themselves, as well as develop transferrable skills that will help them be successful in any field they pursue.</p>

<p>Ultimately, my main goal in life is to simply change the lives of others. I hope to have a positive impact on the lives of everyone I come in contact with no matter how small it may be! Whether that is through outstanding customer service being an IT Help Desk Technician, my music, community outreach, etc. I want people to look back at the experiences that they had with me and smile!</p>
