<div class="paragraph">							
<p>Ruben Compean was born in the City of Chicago. He currently attends Year Up Chicago and he is also a part-time employee at The Home Depot in the Lumber and Building Materials Department. Year Up is one-year intense training program that enhances my current skill set in hardware, software programming and professionalism. His goal is to do what he loves most and that’s using technology whether that’s fixing them or helping people better understand their computer so they can fix it themselves. Ruben is a highly motivated, intellectual and determined worker. His goal is always to give 100% customer satisfaction.</p>  
 
<p>Hobbies would include watching baseball games either on TV or going to them, his favorite team is the Chicago Cubs. He loves listening to music when he is doing independent work and will do other recreational activities such as football or golf. Ruben also loves gaming hardcore on his Xbox 360 and he can be very competitive in and outside of his gaming life. If he had to pick one of his favorite food types, it would have to be Mexican Food and his favorite Mexican dish would consist of tacos.
