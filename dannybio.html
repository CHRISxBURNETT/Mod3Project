<div class="paragraph">							
<p>Hello my name is Danny Chandler Jr. Iâ€™m very passion for technology because of video games. Been playing video games since I was three years old and was impress with the software and hardware. I want to be a video game designer in order to make games for future generations. In order to pursue my passion, I joined Year Up Chicago.</p>

<p>Since joining Year Up Chicago I became a better professional. Year Up has gave me so much confidence in myself to complete projects. Not only had I improve in my tech skills but my soft skills grown tremendously. I would have never thought I be able to network with other professionals and give tours to mentors, professionals, and future classes. Also I have so much support from the staff and my coworkers.</p>

<p>Outside of attending Year Up I like to play video games, basketball, football and to walk my dog in the park. Playing video games has help relieve the stress that I face every day. Helps keep my mind active and open to the outside world. Playing basketball and football keeps me active. Enjoy playing with friends to have fun and be competitive with them.
